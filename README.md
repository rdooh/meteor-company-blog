# WM Meteor Blog

## Overview
Create a blogging app that is available to view before signing in. Each user will have their own blog. Each blog entry will consist of: Title, Description, Date/Time, User. Each user can have CUD functionality after signing in.

## Rough Spec
blogs will be listed according to username (e.g. /rdooh/)
blog posts will be listed on the username (personal) page (e.g. /rdooh/)
blog post addresses will be readable, and sub to the username (e.g. /rdooh/why-I-love-meteor)
when logged in, you will get access to some edit/delete buttons beside your listed posts on your personal page
when logged in, you will have a create button on your personal page
when logged in, you may have some extra buttons on the top bar
